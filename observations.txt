I had never worked with Django, so in the begging I got a little confuse.
After studyig and searching some examples in the internet I started to understand better.
I used random data to fill the tables.
I hope you like the solutions that I got from that GET request, I dont know if were that what you wanted but its the way I would do it.

Looking foward to your answer.
